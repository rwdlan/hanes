  "descriptionWiki": "The Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the State of Education in Wales, commonly referred to in Wales as  \u0022The Treason of the Blue Books\u0022 or \u0022The Treachery of the Blue Books\u0022 (Welsh: Brad y Llyfrau Gleision) or just the \u0022Blue Books\u0022 is a three-part publication by the British government in 1847 about education in Wales. Commissioned in response to government concern over unrest in the region, the publication caused uproar in Wales, where many saw it as disparaging the Welsh, as it was particularly scathing in its view of the nonconformity, the Welsh language  and the morality of the Welsh people in general. The Welsh sobriquet Brad y Llyfrau Gleision was from the name of a play satirising the reports, and those who gave evidence to the inquiry, which was published seven years after the reports. The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales says that the name \u0022took hold of the public imagination to such an extent that ever since the report has been known by that name\u0022.\nAccording to the author and business academic, Simon Brooks, the Blue Books are regarded today as \u0022colonial diktat\u0022, and are \u0022the most important ideological intervention by the British state in Wales in the 19th century.\u0022 However the inquiry did not lead to any governmental action and the hostile reaction was mainly aimed at the comments about Welsh morality.   One of the many legacies of the reports that prominent Welsh nationalist activist Saunders Lewis opined in The Fate of the Language in 1962 was that Wales embraced bilingualism, through the requirement to learn English as a second language.",
