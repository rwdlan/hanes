  "descriptionWiki": "Y Wladfa (Welsh pronunciation: [\u0259 \u02C8wladva], \u0027The Colony\u0027), also occasionally Y Wladychfa Gymreig (Welsh pronunciation: [\u0259 wla\u02C8d\u0259\u03C7va \u0261\u0259m\u02C8rei\u0261], \u0027The Welsh Settlement\u0027), refers to the establishment of settlements by Welsh colonists and immigrants in the Argentine Patagonia, beginning in 1865, mainly along the coast of the lower Chubut Valley. In 1881, the area became part of the Chubut National Territory of Argentina which, in 1955, became Chubut Province.\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Argentine government encouraged emigration from Europe to populate Argentina and south Patagonia particularly, which until the Conquest of the Desert had sparsely rural and coastal settlements. Between 1856 and 1875, 34 settlements of immigrants of various nationalities were established in Santa Fe and Entre R\u00EDos. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe by 44 Welsh people who left Chubut, and another group settled at Coronel Su\u00E1rez in southern Buenos Aires Province.\nThe Welsh-Argentine community is centred on Gaiman, Dolavon, Trelew, and Trevelin. There are 70,000 Welsh-Patagonians. However,\nChubut estimates the number of Patagonian Welsh speakers to be about 1,500, while other estimates put the number at 5,000.",
