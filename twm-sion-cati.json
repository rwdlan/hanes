  "descriptionWiki": "Twm Si\u00F4n Cati is a prominent figure in Welsh folklore. While many tales of cunning and trickery have been associated with Twm, he is also said to have been a respected antiquary, genealogist and poet and to have risen to the position of magistrate and mayor of Brecon as well as being a relative of the occultist John Dee.\nDue to legends of Twm stealing from the rich and powerful and helping the poor and needy, he became known in the 19th century as \u0022The Welsh Robin Hood\u0022 and \u0022The Welsh Rob Roy\u0022.",
