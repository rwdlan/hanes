  "descriptionWiki": "The Red \u0022Lady\u0022 of Paviland (Welsh: \u0022Dynes\u0022 Goch Pafiland) is an Upper Paleolithic partial male skeleton dyed in red ochre and buried in Wales 33,000 BP (approximately 31,000 BCE). The bones were discovered in 1823 by William Buckland in an archaeological dig at Goat\u0027s Hole Cave (Paviland cave) which is a limestone cave between Port Eynon and Rhossili on the Gower Peninsula, near Swansea in south Wales. Buckland believed the skeleton was a Roman-era female. Later, William Solace examined Goat\u0027s Cave Paviland in 1912. There, Solace found flint arrow heads and tools and correctly concluded that the skeleton was in fact a male hunter-gatherer or warrior during the last Ice Age.\nGoat\u0027s Hole was occupied throughout prehistory. Artefacts are predominantly Aurignacian, but also include examples from the earlier Mousterian, and later Gravettian and Creswellian periods. The site is the oldest known ceremonial burial in Western Europe.\nThere have been calls to return the red skeleton of Paviland to Wales where it was discovered, and also specifically to Swansea.",
