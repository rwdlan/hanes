  "descriptionWiki": "Betsi Cadwaladr (24 May 1789 \u2013 17 July 1860), also known as Beti Cadwaladr, Betsi Davis, and Elizabeth Davis, was a Welsh nurse. She began nursing on travelling ships in her 30s (1820s) and later nursed in the Crimean War alongside Florence Nightingale.\nHer name today is synonymous with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (Welsh: Bwrdd Iechyd Prifysgol Betsi Cadwaladr), the largest health organisation in Wales. In 2016, she was named as one of \u0022the 50 greatest Welsh men and women of all time\u0022 \nOne of the few sources for her life is the book \u0027Autobiography of Elizabeth Davis\u0027, published in 1857.  This was based on a series of interviews with the author Jane Williams  towards the end of Cadwaladr\u0027s life.",
