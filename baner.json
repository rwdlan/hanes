  "descriptionWiki": "The flag of Wales (Welsh: Baner Cymru or Y Ddraig Goch, meaning \u0027the red dragon\u0027) consists of a red dragon passant on a green and white field.  As with many heraldic charges, the exact representation of the dragon is not standardised in law.\nThe colours of green and white are the colours of the Tudor family; a standard featuring the red dragon was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul\u0027s Cathedral, and a dragon added as a supporter of the Tudor royal arms.\nIt was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. Several cities include a dragon in their flag design, including Cardiff, the Welsh capital.",
