  "descriptionWiki": "Magnus Maximus (Classical Latin: [\u02C8ma\u02D0gnus \u02C8ma\u02D0ksimus]; died 28 August 388) was Roman emperor in the West from 383 to 388. He usurped the throne from emperor Gratian.\nBorn in Gallaecia, he served as an officer in Britain under Theodosius the Elder during the Great Conspiracy. In 383, he was proclaimed emperor in Britannia, and in Gaul the next year, while Gratian\u0027s brother Valentinian II retained Italy, Pannonia, Hispania, and Africa. In 387, Maximus\u0027s ambitions led him to invade Italy, resulting in his defeat by Theodosius I at the Battle of Poetovio in 388. In the view of some historians, his death marked the end of direct imperial presence in Northern Gaul and Britannia.",
