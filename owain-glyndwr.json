  "descriptionWiki": "Owain ap Gruffydd (28 May 1354 \u2013 20 September 1415), commonly known as Owain Glynd\u0175r (Glyn D\u0175r, pronounced [\u02C8o\u028Aain \u0261l\u0268\u031En\u02C8du\u02D0r], anglicised as Owen Glendower) was a Welsh leader, soldier and military commander in the late Middle Ages, who led a 15-year-long Welsh revolt with the aim of ending English rule in Wales. He was an educated lawyer, forming the first Welsh parliament under his rule, and was the last native-born Welshman to claim the title Prince of Wales. \nDuring the year 1400, Glynd\u0175r, a Welsh soldier and Lord of Glyndyfrdwy had a dispute with a neighbouring English Lord, the event which spiraled into a national revolt pitted common Welsh countrymen and nobles against the English military. In response to the rebellion, discriminatory penal laws were implemented against the Welsh people; this deepened civil unrest and significantly increased support for Glynd\u0175r across Wales. Then, in 1404, after a series of successful castle sieges and several battlefield victories for the Welsh, Glynd\u0175r gained control of most of Wales and was proclaimed by his supporters as the Prince of Wales, in the presence of envoys from several other European kingdoms, and military aid was given from France, Brittany, and Scotland. He proceeded to summon the first Welsh parliament in Machynlleth, where he outlined his plans for Wales which included building two universities, reinstating the medieval Welsh laws of Hywel Dda, and build an independent Welsh church.\nThe war continued, and over the next several years, the English gradually gained control of large parts of Wales. By 1409 Owain\u0027s last remaining castles of Harlech and Aberystwyth had been captured by English forces. Glynd\u0175r refused two royal pardons and retreated to the Welsh hills and mountains with his remaining forces, where he continued to resist English rule by using guerrilla warfare tactics, until his disappearance in 1415, when he was recorded to have died by one of his followers, Adam of Usk.\nGlynd\u0175r was never captured or killed, and he was also never betrayed despite being a fugitive of the law with a large bounty. In Welsh culture he acquired a mythical status alongside Cadwaladr, Cynon ap Clydno and King Arthur as a folk hero \u2013 \u0027The Foretold Son\u0027 (Welsh: Y Mab Darogan). In William Shakespeare\u0027s play Henry IV, Part 1 he appears as the character Owen Glendower as a king rather than a prince.\n\n",
